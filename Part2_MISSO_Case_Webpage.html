<title> MISSO Case Part 2 </title>

<h2 style = "font-size:100px;"><center> MiSSo WeBPage<br><br> </h2></center>
<b><p style = "font-size:30px;"><b> Case Directions: As a junior web developer for MISSO your job is to: </b><ol style = "font-size:30px;"> <li> Right click on this page and hit 'save as', rename the file to 'yourgroupsname'.html </li><li> Locate the saved file on your folder and open it on a text editor application (i.e. Sublime Text, Notepad++, Visual Studio) </li><li> Begin editing the html code so that the blurbs make sense. </li> <p style = "font-size:30px;"> <center> You will see some html that needs fixing. You can tell if they need fixing by some of the helpful blurbs. </center></b></p>
<br> <center> <p style = "font-size:60px;font-family: Courier"> For example, look a red square cell! <br><br><table cellpadding= '64'><tr><td bgcolor = 'blue'> </td></tr></table></p>
Shown above is a blue square cell, but the helpful blurb wants it to be red. You go into the code and change the html code to solve the problem. I would go into line 19, replace the blue in bgcolor = 'blue' and type in 'red'. Try it yourself, save the html file and open the file on a browser, you will now see a red square cell like this:<br><br> <table cellpadding = '64'> <tr><td bgcolor = 'red'></td></tr></table><br><p style = "font-size:50px;">Think of this as an html escape room. A good resource to use is w3schools html.  Good Luck! </center>
